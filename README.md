our dataset id is DS261 which is named as Car resale data - 2023 (car_resale_prices.csv) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulmenon1758/car-resale-prices
This dataset is interesting to us because :  Resale value often impacts purchasing decisions. Thus, it is interesting to see how the car fuel type has an affect on the resale price.
#our research question is:-
Is there a difference in the mean resale price of cars between different  fuel types?
